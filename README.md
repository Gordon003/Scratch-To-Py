# Introduction to Scratch-To-Python
Scratch-To-Python is a free open-source library that is designed to help primary/high school students progress from Scratch to Python much more easily while having fun.

Perfect for advanced Scratch students who want to progress to actual programming language while learning good syntax and style in the future.

It will be continuously updated till the MVP of making most Scratch game are met.

If you have any feedback, make sure to email me at gordonchen0@gmail.com.

Been developing since January 2021.

# Requirement
```python
pip install scratch-to-python
```

# Structure of Folder
* images
  * speech.png
* backgrounds
* sounds

**NOTE**: speech.png are required to allow speech bubble for all sprites, otherwise this library won't work. I am working to put that image in the package library instead.

# Help
I am continuing to not only improve on this library but also provide past Scratch projects in Python to give you a better understanding on this library and its usefulness.

The online documentation will be added and updated when done so.

# Dependencies
Scratch-To-Python is obviously very dependent on Pygame to display our game application on Python. You can check the pygame library for more information [here](https://github.com/pygame/pygame)

⋅⋅* Pygame 2.0.1
